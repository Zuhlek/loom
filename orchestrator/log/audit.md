# Audit Log

## 2026-05-11 - loom-ui-phase-update - whitelist-pair-coupling-invariant

The change required updating two whitelists in lock-step: client
`KNOWN_ARTIFACTS` (`loom-view-live.tsx`) and server `ARTIFACT_FILES`
(`loom.ts`). The design.md doc made the invariant explicit ("ARTIFACT_FILES
must be a superset of KNOWN_ARTIFACTS"), and Build landed both edits in
one phase per Q2=B. This worked, but it's a textbook drift trap: a
future change that adds one artifact name to only one side will appear
to work in the short run (the file shows in the tree, the click does
nothing) and reads as a UI bug, not a missing whitelist entry. Two
plausible future moves:
- **Document the invariant** in a contract / lint rule (cheap, but
  relies on people reading it).
- **Single source of truth** — promote the list to a shared `@loom/...`
  constants module imported by both server and client. This is a real
  refactor with package-graph cost but eliminates the drift class.
The current change set didn't need to act on this; flagging it for
`/tune` curation as a candidate follow-up.

## 2026-05-11 - loom-ui-phase-update - single-layer-T-003-justification

T-003 ("server ARTIFACT_FILES whitelist") was a single-layer task —
ui-server only, no client-side companion in the same task. The Plan
contract requires that single-layer tasks carry an explicit
justification. T-003's spec included one: *"Single-layer (server-only)
justified: this is the one-line whitelist constant that gates disk
reads; per Q2=B the boundary was explicitly relaxed for this constant
only."* That justification ties back to the Idea-phase branching
decision and is verifiable at audit time — exactly the shape the
contract intends. Proof that the "single-layer requires justification"
rule from the Plan contract works in practice: the justification was
present, was specific, was tied to a decision artifact, and made the
audit trivial.

## 2026-05-11 - loom-ui-phase-update - first-attempt-green-on-mechanical-changes

All four tasks landed green on first attempt with zero retries. The
factors that made this possible:
- design.md included exact before/after snippets for every non-trivial
  edit (the `phaseStatesFor` rewrite, the `loom-view.tsx` ternary
  cascade rewrite, the two whitelist replacements).
- The Plan listed `files-likely-touched` accurately (no scope creep
  discovered at build time).
- The Idea-phase grep audit ("`PhaseId` consumers") was complete; no
  unexpected callers surfaced.
This is the design payoff: when the upstream phases produce concrete,
verifiable specs, Build becomes mechanical and Review becomes short.
Worth holding up as a reference shape for future small refactors.

## 2026-05-11 - phase-validators - single-invocation-lifecycle-mid-project

The orchestrator originally exited after each phase
(one-decision-per-invocation). Mid-project the user edited
`weave/SKILL.md` to loop until Review→done in a single invocation,
adding a `Lifecycle state` framework with `active` / `complete`
values. The phase-validators project spans both eras: Idea ran under
the exit-after-phase model (separate `/weave` invocations), then
Design / Plan / Build / Review ran under the loop-until-done model
(single `/weave` invocation). The seam was crossed cleanly because
`pipeline.md` is the canonical state surface and both orchestrator
modes read/write the same sections — the only added field on the new
model is `Lifecycle state`, which the existing parser was
forward-compatible with. This validates the "pipeline.md is canonical
state" architectural commitment: the orchestrator's own behavior can
change while in-flight projects continue without state-loss. Reusable
cue: when the orchestrator's loop semantics change, projects in
flight survive iff every modified section is additive on
`pipeline.md`.

## 2026-05-11 - phase-validators - recursive-orchestrator-self-edit

This project recursively edited the very orchestrator that drove
it — the three new `validator.md` files live under the same
`orchestrator/weave/phases/` tree that the orchestrator reads on
dispatch. No reload cycle was needed at any point because
`validator.md` is loaded by file presence (predicate-based dispatch:
"if `phases/<phase>/validator.md` exists, the user gets the
three-option rerun-or-continue surface"), not by code that requires
re-import. The recursion is shallow — the orchestrator didn't
dispatch the new validators against this project, it just authored
them — but the architectural invariant ("orchestrator surface is
file-presence-driven, not code-driven") is what made it safe to
self-edit. Reusable cue: predicate-based file-presence dispatch is
what enables an orchestrator to extend itself in-flight without a
restart cycle.

## 2026-05-11 - phase-validators - verbatim-duplication-as-deliberate-no-helper-tradeoff

The seed forbade shared helper files (`no shared helpers; each
validator.md is self-contained, like phases/idea/validator.md`). Q05
+ Q06 affirmed this — each new validator restates the same ~30 lines
of Output template + severity rubric + User-Facing Decision paragraph
+ RETURN YAML block. This violates P3 (Zero Duplication) on a
literal-line-count reading. The deliberate trade-off: extending the
validator family in the future (or editing the boilerplate) requires
touching all N files in lock-step, but the orchestrator dispatch path
stays trivial (no include / partial mechanism) and each validator
file is independently readable. The mitigation: T-007's grep gates
re-assert all the boilerplate per-file, so drift is caught at
next-rerun-or-CI time. Worth capturing because future contributors
may want to extract a `templates/validator-frame.md`; this entry is
the record that the current setup is *intentionally* duplicated, not
accidentally so. Reusable cue: P3 is *negotiable when the duplication
is by-design and gate-asserted*; flag for `/tune` re-evaluation if
the boilerplate ever grows past one screen or starts to drift in
practice.
