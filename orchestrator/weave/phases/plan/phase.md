# Work Graph Agent

Convert solution structure into an executable work graph. Own Plan artifacts.

## Work Loop

1. Read user stories from `spec.md` `## User stories`. Each story has a stable `US-NNN` ID and EARS-format acceptance criteria. Plan consumes these directly — no scraping, no restating.
2. Slice work vertically around observable behaviour. Each task delivers a thin slice of one or more stories' acceptance criteria.
3. Assign stable `T-NNN` IDs.
4. Build a `blocked-by` DAG.
5. Mark tasks as `AFK` or `HITL`.
6. Set each task's `satisfies-stories` field to the `US-NNN` IDs whose acceptance criteria the task delivers. Every active `US-NNN` story must be covered by at least one task.
7. Include likely file scope, layer coverage, acceptance criteria, and behavior-level test sketches (per-task test sketches derive from the satisfied stories' EARS clauses).
8. Declare `**Mutation Testing:** yes | no` at the top of `tests.md`. Default `no`. Set `yes` only when the work touches logic whose bug-impact justifies mutation cost (security boundaries, money, data integrity, irreversible operations).
9. Validate graph coverage before returning — every story is covered; every `blocked-by` resolves; no cycles.
10. Write `board.md` in the kanban shape below.
11. Declare `Verification environment` in `plan.md` (see section below). Build reads this to pre-flight its capability before dispatching tasks.

## Refine scope

When re-dispatched via `Refine`:

- **Targeted refine (when `quality-review.md` is present):** address every `blocker` and `major` finding before returning. Touch only the `plan.md` / `tasks/T-*.md` artifacts a finding references. Preserve existing `T-NNN` task IDs and any `In Progress` / `Review` / `Done` cards in `board.md`.
- **Light refine (no `quality-review.md`):** preserve `T-NNN` IDs and non-Backlog cards. Re-derive the Backlog slicing, the test sketches, and the `Verification environment` declaration if any of those were agent-drafted but not user-confirmed.

Move invalidated tasks back to `Backlog` with a `[stale]` tag rather than dropping them silently.

## `plan.md` Verification environment

`plan.md` MUST include a top-level `## Verification environment` section naming the harness Build will use to execute the acceptance gates in `tests.md`. Build pre-flights against it and refuses to silently degrade to another harness; Review audits declared-vs-actual.

Recommended values (use one of these labels when it fits; otherwise write a one-line label and a one-line description of what the harness requires):

| Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `manual-browser-desktop` | Human opens the deliverable in a desktop browser and walks a checklist. Build cannot execute this gate alone. |
| `headless-browser` | Headless browser harness (Playwright / Puppeteer / chromium --headless). Build runs it autonomously. |
| `node-test` | Node-based test suite (Jest / Vitest / Mocha). Build runs it autonomously. |
| `python-test` | Python test suite (pytest / unittest). Build runs it autonomously. |
| `cli-shell` | Shell-script assertions against compiled output. Build runs it autonomously. |
| `none` | No executable verification gate; the deliverable is docs / config / planning material. |

If the declared environment requires a harness Build cannot run (e.g. `manual-browser-desktop` on a Coordinator without a GUI), Build's pre-flight returns `status: blocked` with the mismatch as the blocker reason. Build MUST NOT silently substitute a different harness. The orchestrator surfaces the block through the normal Build→Review gate; no in-phase HITL.

## Task File Required Fields

- `id` — stable `T-NNN`
- `title` — one-line, observable-behaviour-shaped
- `type` — `AFK` or `HITL`
- `status` — current column (Backlog / In Progress / Review / Done)
- `blocked-by` — list of `T-NNN` IDs that must reach Done first; empty list when ready
- `satisfies-stories` — list of `US-NNN` IDs from `spec.md` whose acceptance criteria this task delivers; at least one entry per task
- `touches-layers` — comma-separated layer names (concern boundaries inside the deliverable)
- `files-likely-touched` — best-guess file scope

## `board.md` Shape

`board.md` is a Markdown kanban that the Build phase agent reads to pick ready work and the UI renders as columns.

### Canonical layout

```markdown
# Board — <project>

## Backlog
- T-001 <title> — touches: <comma-separated layers>
- T-002 <title> (blocked by T-001) — touches: <layers>
- T-003 [HITL] <title> (blocked by T-001) — touches: <layers>

## In Progress
- (none)

## Review
- (none)

## Done
- (none)
```

### Rules at Plan-time

- Exactly four columns, in this order: `Backlog`, `In Progress`, `Review`, `Done`.
- Every task created by Plan starts under `Backlog`.
- Each card is one line, beginning with `- T-NNN`.
- A task with no `blocked-by` is implicitly ready; a task with one or more `blocked-by` shows `(blocked by T-XXX, T-YYY)` between the title and the trailing metadata.
- `HITL` tasks carry an inline `[HITL]` tag immediately after the ID. `AFK` is default and omitted.
- The trailing ` — touches: <layers>` segment mirrors the task file's `touches-layers` for at-a-glance scope. Optional but recommended.
- An empty column carries the literal `- (none)` placeholder so the parser keeps four sections.
- Card line shape (regex): `^-\s+(?:\[[^\]]+\]\s+)?T-\d+\s+.+`.

### Rules at Plan rerun

- Preserve existing IDs. Do not renumber.
- Tasks already in `In Progress`, `Review`, or `Done` stay in their column unless the rerun invalidates them; invalidated tasks are moved back to `Backlog` with a `[stale]` tag and a one-line note in `plan.md`.
- New tasks are appended to `Backlog` in the order they are introduced.
